Z-fighting happens when two faces are coplanar within a hair AND overlap in that
plane -- typically a backing plate whose inner face lands exactly on the inner face
of the box behind it. The renderer cannot decide which is in front, so it flickers.
This finds those pairs and says where they are and which materials are involved, so
a fix is a measurement rather than a hunt.

Reports per piece: number of offending pairs, the overlapping area, and the worst
offenders as "plane -> material A vs material B".

# 0.2 mm. Real z-fighting needs near-exact coincidence -- two faces generated from
# the same constant (a backing at y=T and a skim whose inner face is also at y=T).
# The old 2.5mm threshold flagged faces that merely sit close, which do NOT fight at
# this scale, and it made the whole measurement swing with sub-millimetre vertex
# jitter from bmesh's bevel. Coincident-by-construction pairs stay coincident across

# 0.2 mm, the "definitely broken" gate.
#
# CORRECTION, and the reason this comment is now long: it used to claim that at this
# tolerance the whole kit reported 0 cm2 in every one of the 14 families, so passing it
# discriminated nothing. That WAS true when written, and the three corrections below
# made it false -- a dormers auditor measured 147 cm2 here. A tool that states a
# measurement it no longer has is the exact fault I have been holding agents to, so:
# do not quote a number from this comment. Run it.
#
# Run 0.5 mm as well before shipping to an engine: surfaces half a millimetre apart do
# not shimmer in these renders but can at distance, where depth precision is far
# coarser than Blender's. Override with ZFIGHT_TOL.
#
# THREE FAULTS WERE FOUND IN THIS TOOL IN ONE SESSION, EACH BY AN AGENT AUDITING ITS OWN
# FAMILY -- worth knowing before trusting a fourth number:
#   1. It compared each face's plane offset along ITS OWN canonical normal, meaningless
#      when normals differ slightly and centres are far apart. A deck soffit and valley
#      beam genuinely 4.8 mm apart read as 0.39 mm; 3987 of dormers' 4195 were false.
#   2. The bucket key was the normal rounded to 0.01 with neighbour registration on the
#      DISTANCE slot only, so coplanar faces whose normals rounded to different keys were
#      NEVER COMPARED -- 543 cm2 invisible in roofs alone. Closing that made buckets ~8x
#      larger, which tripped the old 400 size cap and made the tool silently compare
#      NOTHING for a whole round. BUCKET_CAP must move with the fan-out.
#   3. Measuring at face CENTRES traded false positives for false negatives both ways:
#      the old 0.99 guard admitted 8.1 deg of splay, so a HINGE pair sharing a corner
#      read 0.001 mm and put props top of the kit at 3408 cm2 when only 63 cm2 (1.8%)
#      was reachable. It now takes the MAX separation across the CLIPPED OVERLAP.
#
# AND AREA IS NOT THE POINT -- REACHABILITY IS. Ray-sample before acting: gables' 718 cm2
# is 0.0% reachable (validated harness: 27% of the same piece's faces ARE), roofs once
# "closed" 1211 cm2 of which 17.0 reachable, props' 3408 was 87% hinge artefact. A sealed
# overlap is not worth a triangle of churn.

# each pair BEFORE it was counted, so a piece whose coincidence is MANY SMALL LAPS read
# as perfectly clean: signage measured 0.0 cm2 at both tolerances while carrying
# 230.5 cm2 of RAY-REACHABLE coincidence over 558 pairs -- every individual lap ~2.1 cm2
# against a 15 cm2 floor. Strap-iron segments and glazed-cage faces are exactly that
