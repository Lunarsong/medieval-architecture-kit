"""Structural audit of an assembled scene: geometry standing through the roof, and
holes in wall runs.

    blender -b --python check_layouts.py                      # out/layouts.blend
    blender -b --python check_layouts.py -- out/inn_example.blend

Two faults that check_collisions.py cannot see, because both are about geometry that
is WRONG relative to a surface rather than merely touching it:

  THROUGH-ROOF   a wall, post or beam whose vertices have roof BELOW them and no roof
                 above -- i.e. it has emerged through the visible roof surface. A roof
                 course bearing on a wall head is not this, which is why the collision
                 count is useless for it.
  WALL-RUN GAPS  a run of wall pieces along one face plane with a hole in it. Prints
                 the size, which is diagnostic: a hole of exactly T_TIMBER (0.24) at a
                 corner means a corner piece has been moved out of the T x T void it
                 exists to fill.

Deliberate voids show up as large gaps (a 3-bay crossing reads 6.00 m, an open arcade
reads its full span). Judge by the SIZE, not by the count.

# giving 690 / 631 / 1598 verts. CAVEAT when reading the output: a bargeboard legitimately
# LAPS the rake, so a few centimetres is correct. Judge by DEPTH -- a lapping barge reads
# ~0.05 m, a barge standing proud of its verge or floating off the eave reads > 0.5 m.

# never tested" blind spot -- it is the opposite mistake, and I made it.
#
# A dormer EMERGES through the roof surface by design: it is planted in a slope,
# so every vertex of it has roof below and nothing above, which is exactly what
# this test looks for. Adding 'Dormer' duly reported all six placed dormers at a
# depth of 3.270 m -- and reported the identical 3.270 m before and after a fix
# that measurably shortened them by 0.506 m. The number is the dormer's height
# above the field, not its over-run, so it cannot discriminate and it drowns the
# real rows in noise.
#
# THE GATE FOR A DORMER OVER-RUNNING THE RIDGE is its placed world extent along
# the slope axis against the ridge piece's far face: SM_Dormer_Gabled_1m5 went
# 2.9701 -> 2.4639 against a far face of 2.5468 and a ridge centre-line of
# 2.3600. Measure that, not this.
